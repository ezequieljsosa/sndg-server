pathwayssearch.grouphelp=Pathway score uses Protein properties in its calculation. There are many proteins in one pathway, so there are many ways to combine the values. The possible values are:* max (Ex: most druggable protein of the pathway)* sum (Ex: proteins in the pathway with binding activity)* min (Ex: protein with the lowest centrality)* avg (Ex: hit in deg proteins / total proteins in the pw)
